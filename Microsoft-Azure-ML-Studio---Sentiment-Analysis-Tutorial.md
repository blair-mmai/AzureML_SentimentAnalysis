# **Scenario-Based Tutorial**

## **Scenario**
As a member of the Data Science team at Bathurst Inc., you have been tasked to create a sentiment analysis tool using Microsoft Azure ML Studio to predict whether tweets related to your products and services are positive and negative for the purposes of:

* Providing the customer experience team with “strong positive” tweets so they can generate an outbound marketing campaign to get promoters to provide online recommendations and strengthen your online presence
* Providing the customer retention team with “strong negative” tweets so they can address the issues with the customers and turn detractors into (at worst) neutral, (at best) promoters of the company
